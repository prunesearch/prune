<!-- Title: {% block title %}How Prune Works{% endblock %} -->
<h1 id="how-does-prune-work">How Does Prune Work?</h1>
<p>Prune is a self-hosted search engine software that operates on
a distributed network of multiple servers all connected to one project.
This unique architecture ensures that Prune is not reliant on any single
entity, making it more resilient to censorship and manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="decentralized-architecture">Decentralized Architecture</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional search engines that rely on centralized servers,
Pruneâ€™s network comprises independent servers, each maintaining its own
copy of the index. This distributed approach eliminates the single point
of failure, ensuring that Prune remains accessible even if some servers
become unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="spider-and-application">Spider and Application</h2>
<p>At the heart of Prune lies a two-component system: the spider and the
application. The spider, the tireless explorer of the web, proactively
crawls through the internet, gathering information about new and updated
pages. It then indexes this data, making it searchable within Prune.</p>
<p>The application, on the other hand, serves as the user-facing
interface, allowing individuals to query the index and retrieve relevant
results. It acts as a gateway to the distributed network, seamlessly
connecting users with the information they seek.</p>
<h2 id="python-modules">Python Modules</h2>
<p>Prune is built upon a solid foundation of Python modules, leveraging
the power of open-source libraries like Flask and Requests. Flask, a web
framework, provides the structure for building the application, while
Requests facilitates communication with external websites, allowing the
spider to crawl the web effectively.</p>
<p>This combination of a decentralized architecture, effective data
indexing, and robust Python modules ensures that Prune delivers a
reliable and efficient search experience, offering users a
censorship-resistant and privacy-focused alternative to traditional
search engines.</p>
